# Roadmap

- [ ] Split PianoCore library from the PianoGame smoke testing environment to enforce strict boundaries for engine vs games
- [ ] Re-add the unit tests I previously had for the game lib into the PianoCore engine
- [ ] Take a moment to assess the publicly exposed interface of the engine and refactor as necessary
